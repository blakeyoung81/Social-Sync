00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
Look at this game. I just played in the Smith-Morah.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,200
E4, C5, then it comes D4.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,700
CD4, we're going to the Smith-Morah gambit.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,500
We continued, and this is kind of a weird transposition,

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,600
but the reason I put my queen right here on E2

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,100
is because they always missed this tactic right here.

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,700
All right? So he missed it.

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,700
He's going to get it back soon because I missed this attack right here.

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,500
I, for some reason, this is a one-minute game,

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,800
thought that he was threatening checkmate,

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,400
and so I said, okay, I'm abandoning my rook.

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,900
I'm sorry, I'm abandoning my knight,

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,400
but you're going to have to rearrange,

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,500
and so that's what I did.

15
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
He comes back, and now I have to defend myself

16
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,300
from this attack. He's trying to skewer me,

17
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,400
and I also got to defend here

18
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,500
so that I can then launch my attack on the king side.

19
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,500
We'll see what happens.

20
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
I stop, and then I'm attacking this guy.

21
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,700
I'm saying, hey, I don't really like that you're getting in my space.

22
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,400
He comes back. I attack the queen, which is not the best move,

23
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,500
and now I should have put on the defile and made some things happen.

24
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,100
Fortunately, he does not take the advantage to kick my knight away,

25
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,900
and so I'm able to make this move.

26
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,800
Why? So that I can make that move next,

27
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,400
and so he doesn't checkmate me on the next move

28
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,900
and not play this f5 winning my knight and the game,

29
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,400
and now I'm able to finally play this move.

30
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,700
Indeed, it is the best move, and here we start cooking.

31
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,800
All right, so we're breaking this connection on the e file,

32
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,300
and we're also forcing his rook to move up,

33
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,400
and then I would move here.

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,600
Then you'd have to move away,

35
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,300
and I'm going to win that pawn eventually.

36
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,200
He just abandons it for some reason.

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,300
I think he's trying to save here and mobilize his queen.

38
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,300
Doesn't work, though, and watch this ending, folks.

39
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,300
Boom. This is a classic mate.

40
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,600
What's the best move? Indeed, it is a double check.

41
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,000
And why does he move here?

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,100
Well, that's checkmate, and that's what happened in the game,

43
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,700
but the reason why he moves there is because if he moves here,

44
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,300
I sacrifice the queen, rook takes, and it's checkmate smothers mate.

45
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,200
