1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
Herpes hits hard. Painful genital ulcers, multi-giant cells would be primary HSV. You treat it with a

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:16,000
cyclovir. So these are primary genital herpes. You'll see like the positive Sanktsmere.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,520
You'll see a rash on the genitals and you should be giving them a cyclovir which is a nucleoside

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:36,640
analogue and it's converted into a cyclovir monophosphate principally through the virus

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:48,400
encoded thymidine kinase. That's definitely important. So basically it gets incorporated

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,520
into the DNA chain and then it terminates the DNA sequence. That's how it stops primary genital

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,080
herpes. So HSV is stopped with it. Buzzwords, painful vesicles in the arithmetic base,

8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,120
tendering guenolimb adenopathy, Sanktsmere, multi-nucleated giant cells associated with HSV2,

9
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:17,120
primarily genital, neonatal, HSV, HIV co-infections. The link exists because HSV disrupts epithelial

10
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:25,840
integrity and recruits your CD4 positive T cells. So you get the direct contact. The virus

11
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,920
replicates through the DNA polymerase, through thymidine kinase, kinase, then it's latent,

12
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,680
and then a cyclovir is needed to kill it.

13
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,280
All right, so we've got to get that chain termination. Practice question, 24-year-old man,

14
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:54,400
painful lesions, clusters of vesicles, arithmetic base. So that's already herpes simplex virus,

15
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,200
Sanktsmere, they're giving us that as well. Oral medications used, what's the mechanism?

16
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,480
It requires viral thymidine kinase for activation. All right, so acyclovir and its pro-drugs are

17
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,000
nucleoside analogs that rely on HSV encoded thymidine kinase for activation, ensuring selectivity.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,560
They're phosphorylated, and then they can inhibit the viral DNA polymerase.

19
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,160
So inhibits neuraminase, that's going to be, oh, Ssantimivir, that's like a flu agent,

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,280
UU for people who got the flu, promotes up-regulation into ferron synthesis, immune boost pathway,

21
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:41,040
and not going to be antiviral at all. Inhibits viral protease, that's HIV and HCV drug classes.

22
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,720
Like, Indenivir, that's a retroviral assembly.

23
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,200
Influenza A is the blocks of viral encoding,

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,040
mantidine is a medication that does that. If you found this helpful, like and subscribe,
