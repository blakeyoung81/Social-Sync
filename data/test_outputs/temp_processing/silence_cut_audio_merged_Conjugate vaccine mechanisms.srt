1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Six month old infant receives a vaccine that includes a bacterial capsule polysaccharide conjugated to diphtheria toxoid.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,600
What is the immunological advantage conferred by this conjugation?

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,100
It's going to be enhanced class switching through the T helper cells.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,900
So infants under two years old can't mount a memory response to plain polysaccharide antigens.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,600
They just can't do it.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:31,000
But when you conjugate that capsule to a protein like a tetanus toxoid, then it recruits T helper cells

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,400
and it enables class switching, affinity maturation, and immunological memory.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,700
So that's how HIV vaccines work.

9
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,900
It's not because of the toxoid, but because of that teamwork.

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,400
It's because of that robust T cell dependent immunity.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,200
So let's look at these trap answers.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:57,600
Ucosyl IGA. It's induced by oral and intranasal vaccines and mucosal infections, not systemic conjugates.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,200
TLR4 recognizes your LPS, not capsular polysaccharides, somatic hypermutation,

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,700
the advantage of conjugation as T cell helpers, not diversification.

15
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:15,800
M cells involved in mucosal antigen sampling, unrelated to conjugate vaccines.

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,800
