Here's the corrected SRT:

```
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Did you know that by six months, your mom's antibodies have already worn off?

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,200
So if you have Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, then you are flying so low and breaking.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,599
So your bone marrow is going to make these B cells.

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,120
And then the BTK gene is needed for the transition from pre-B cells to the mature B cells.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,320
And if you have a mutation there, like in Bruton's agammaglobulinemia,

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,600
then the B cells are going to rest in that pre-B stage.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,480
And so that means you get no plasma cells, no antibodies, no immunoglobulins.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,400
So if you see the electrophoresis graph, it's going to be super low for the gamma.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,400
So here's our practice question.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,800
We got a nine-month-old boy who has been to the hospital a couple of times.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,719
Could be anywhere from nine months to ten or eleven.

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:31,400
Pneumonia.

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,160
We've got some pneumonia; he's been in the hospital a couple of times.

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,039
His dad, another male in the family, died of severe infections.

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,960
We have absent B cells.

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,920
Low, I mean, low levels.

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,679
So what are we going to see?

18
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,799
We're going to definitely see absent.

19
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:42,600
Monoclonal spike.

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,000
That would make us think of multiple myeloma.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,280
Beta-gamma bridging.

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,159
That's IgA overproduction or cirrhosis.

23
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,760
Broad-based polyclonal increase.

24
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,439
That would be seen in an autoimmune condition.

25
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:51,400
It's definitely not normal.

26
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,920
So let's think of the buzzwords.

27
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,000
Recurrent pneumonia, H. flu, Staphylococcus aureus, just recurrent pulmonary infections.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,359
Also, just think that if you have a boy with an X-linked disease,

29
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,880
it should cue you into that a little bit too.

30
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,159
So encapsulated organisms, no IgG.

31
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,119
You have poor opsonization.

32
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,120
You have no tonsils or they're absent.

33
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,120
Because those are B-cell dependent organs, or they are underdeveloped.

34
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,439
