Dialogue: 0,00:00:03.12,00:00:07.20,Default,,0,0,0,,40-year-old homeless man with an inflamed spasm and locked jaw. He has a history of drug use and
Dialogue: 0,00:00:07.20,00:00:11.59,Default,,0,0,0,,abduction. What is the path it has taken? Okay, so we have inflamed spasm, open our jaw, we should be
Dialogue: 0,00:00:11.59,00:00:15.04,Default,,0,0,0,,thinking of pre-venous metonymy. That’s what we have; the spores are typically transmitted through a
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.04,00:00:20.00,Default,,0,0,0,,puncture injury like a splinter or a dirty needle use and what we're gonna do here is we use my
Dialogue: 0,00:00:20.00,00:00:24.80,Default,,0,0,0,,contagion to go up, boom, identify what injury to the skin means. That's gonna be your rabies virus
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.80,00:00:27.76,Default,,0,0,0,,and so that's through the bite wound and the peripheral nerve signals. So that's not gonna be
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.76,00:00:31.52,Default,,0,0,0,,your answer, question. We know that this is gonna be tetanus. Why? Because of that jaw. Awesome.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.52,00:00:35.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Right, because the toxin spreads in a great way through the lower motor neurons. To the spinal cord and
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.12,00:00:38.96,Default,,0,0,0,,the spinal cord, it's gonna block your and it causes this spasm of the infection. Right, the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:38.96,00:00:42.80,Default,,0,0,0,,recesses are not. Hey, why is it not B? Contaminated food. Well, our little handy-dandy
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.80,00:00:46.07,Default,,0,0,0,,chromax hematurgies connects too if you just click the description. This is gonna be contaminated
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.07,00:00:50.00,Default,,0,0,0,,food to bloodstream. This is a botch. Right, so that's always starting with contaminated food and spasm
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.00,00:00:53.84,Default,,0,0,0,,rather than sending a typical of your botch. That's why this is not the next infected bloodstream.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.92,00:00:57.12,Default,,0,0,0,,So, bloodstream to brain g. That's gonna get bacterial infection causing your brain abscess.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.12,00:01:01.04,Default,,0,0,0,,That's with headaches, symptoms like that. So you could think of like staphylococcus aureus
Dialogue: 0,00:01:01.04,00:01:04.71,Default,,0,0,0,,from the wound, and you can go through the bloodstream to the brain as a brain abscess. And so symptoms can vary
Dialogue: 0,00:01:04.71,00:01:08.00,Default,,0,0,0,,but yeah we have to look out for that unilateral headache. Let's look at this one. Throat infection.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.00,00:01:12.24,Default,,0,0,0,,Bloodstream nerves. A throat infection: think diphtheria. It's involving the nasopharyngeal
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.24,00:01:16.80,Default,,0,0,0,,exudate. So with diphtheria, we have to think of that smooth membranous pharyngeal exudate.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.80,00:01:20.56,Default,,0,0,0,,And that's gonna be the diphtheria toxin that enters into the system and so that's gonna
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.56,00:01:24.00,Default,,0,0,0,,cause myositis. So that is not getting part of the battle with diphtheria, which is rich, right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.00,00:01:28.32,Default,,0,0,0,,So it affects the skin, and then the nerves and the brain cells like the CNS are the rabies.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.32,00:01:32.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Amnesia of food, botulism especially with the nerve endings. Infected wound,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.00,00:01:35.20,Default,,0,0,0,,bacterial infection. That's diphtheria. All right, so now let's see our next one.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.20,00:01:39.35,Default,,0,0,0,,Mouth nerve brain area. Okay, so from the mouth, it's going to be the herpes simplex virus that
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.35,00:01:43.35,Default,,0,0,0,,causes encephalitis in the brain. And so you could classically think of herpes simplex virus type
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.35,00:01:47.43,Default,,0,0,0,,one that causes your oral labial lesions and it's a super frequent cause of your sporadic and
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.43,00:01:51.84,Default,,0,0,0,,encephalitis. Meningitis when the virus spreads through what? Trigeminal or the olfactory tract.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.84,00:01:55.67,Default,,0,0,0,,So there you'll have, you know, focal neurological deficits, your seizures, your fever,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.67,00:01:58.07,Default,,0,0,0,,your inflammation. All right, last one, this is the correct answer. So, we've gone through
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.07,00:02:02.40,Default,,0,0,0,,systematically identifying what each one is and we know it's going to be F. The reason why is this is
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.40,00:02:06.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Clostridium tetani. So, a puncture wound then travels retrogradely in a great fashion
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.40,00:02:10.24,Default,,0,0,0,,to the most part. That's going to be a correct answer. So, tetanus. So, it's the oxygen exchange of
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.24,00:02:14.07,Default,,0,0,0,,Clostridium tetani. So you transmit it by the spores that are going to be in the skin
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.08,00:02:18.48,Default,,0,0,0,,via the puncture wound. So it's going to germinate, replicate its tetanus toxin that will spread
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.48,00:02:23.04,Default,,0,0,0,,retrogradely through the lower motor neurons to the spinal cord and there it is. These interneurons
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.04,00:02:27.84,Default,,0,0,0,,and cause that spastic paralysis. All right, so that is a breakdown of this question. So once
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.84,00:02:32.08,Default,,0,0,0,,again, quick recap: rabies. There it is, rabies injury to the skin, nerves, and bones and then here's
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.08,00:02:36.00,Default,,0,0,0,,botulism. So the food, amnesia, botulism, infected wound to bloodstream to brain tissue
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.00,00:02:39.68,Default,,0,0,0,,that's a bacterial infection, growth infection, bloodstream nerves, olfactory brain area,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.00,00:02:43.59,Default,,0,0,0,,simplex virus, encephalitis and needle and dart pain. If you guys found this helpful, of course
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.59,00:02:47.12,Default,,0,0,0,,there are a lot of these other AI too well. You can download and simply there's a simplification
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.12,00:02:50.56,Default,,0,0,0,,button that will explain the four basic cups of the dental diagnosis. You can actually have
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.56,00:02:55.20,Default,,0,0,0,,a great your doctor's all bits of my this. Maybe all sorts of great. So if this is helpful, then
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.20,00:02:56.56,Default,,0,0,0,,please consider liking it. ```
