Dialogue: 0,000:00:00.00,000:00:03.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Did you know that by six months your mom's antibodies have already worn off?
Dialogue: 0,000:00:03.76,000:00:09.20,Default,,0,0,0,,And so if you have Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, then you are flying low immunologically speaking.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:09.20,000:00:12.24,Default,,0,0,0,,So your bone marrow is going to make these B cells.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:12.24,000:00:17.52,Default,,0,0,0,,And then the BTK gene is needed for the transition from pre-B cells to immature B cells.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:17.52,000:00:21.52,Highlight,,0,0,0,,And if you have a mutation there, like X-linked Bruton's agammaglobulinemia,
Dialogue: 0,000:00:21.52,000:00:24.08,Highlight,,0,0,0,,then the B cells are going to rest in that pre-B stage.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:24.08,000:00:27.36,Default,,0,0,0,,And so that means you get no plasma cells, no antibodies, no immunoglobulins.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:27.36,000:00:30.72,Default,,0,0,0,,And so if you see the electrophoresis graph, it's going to be very low for the gamma globulin.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:30.72,000:00:31.84,Default,,0,0,0,,So here's our practice question.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:31.84,000:00:34.64,Default,,0,0,0,,We have a nine-month-old boy who has been to the hospital a couple of times,
Dialogue: 0,000:00:34.64,000:00:36.88,Default,,0,0,0,,could be anywhere from nine months to ten or eleven.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:36.88,000:00:37.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Pneumonia.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:37.68,000:00:39.92,Default,,0,0,0,,He's got some pneumonia and has been in the hospital a couple of times.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:39.92,000:00:44.80,Default,,0,0,0,,His dad, another male in the family, died of severe infections.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:44.80,000:00:48.72,Default,,0,0,0,,We have absent CD19 cells and low immunoglobulin levels.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:48.72,000:00:49.60,Default,,0,0,0,,So what are we going to see?
Dialogue: 0,000:00:49.60,000:00:51.20,Default,,0,0,0,,We're definitely going to see absence.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:51.20,000:00:54.00,Default,,0,0,0,,A monoclonal spike would make us think of multiple myeloma.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:54.00,000:00:57.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Beta-gamma bridging indicates IgA overproduction
Dialogue: 0,000:00:57.04,000:00:59.76,Default,,0,0,0,,or cirrhosis, broad-based polyclonal increase.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:59.76,000:01:03.28,Default,,0,0,0,,That would be seen in an autoimmune condition, and it's definitely not normal.
Dialogue: 0,000:01:03.28,000:01:04.96,Default,,0,0,0,,So let's think of the buzzy buzzwords.
Dialogue: 0,000:01:04.96,000:01:09.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Strep pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, just recurrent respiratory infections.
Dialogue: 0,000:01:09.20,000:01:11.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Also, if you have a boy with an X-linked disease,
Dialogue: 0,000:01:11.92,000:01:13.76,Default,,0,0,0,,that should already key you into that a little bit too.
Dialogue: 0,000:01:13.76,000:01:16.24,Highlight,,0,0,0,,So encapsulated organisms, no IgG.
Dialogue: 0,000:01:16.24,000:01:17.60,Default,,0,0,0,,So you have poor opsonization.
Dialogue: 0,000:01:17.60,000:01:19.20,Default,,0,0,0,,You have no tonsils or lymphoid tissue, right?
Dialogue: 0,000:01:19.20,000:01:21.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Because those are B cell-dependent organs that are underdeveloped.
