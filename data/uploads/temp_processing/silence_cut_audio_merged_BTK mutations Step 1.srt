1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Did you know that by six months your mom's antibodies have already worn off?

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,200
And so if you have Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, then you are flying low immunologically speaking.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,240
So your bone marrow is going to make these B cells.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,520
And then the BTK gene is needed for the transition from pre-B cells to immature B cells.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,520
And if you have a mutation there, like X-linked Bruton's agammaglobulinemia,

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,080
then the B cells are going to rest in that pre-B stage.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,360
And so that means you get no plasma cells, no antibodies, no immunoglobulins.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,720
And so if you see the electrophoresis graph, it's going to be very low for the gamma globulin.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,840
So here's our practice question.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,640
We have a nine-month-old boy who has been to the hospital a couple of times,

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,880
could be anywhere from nine months to ten or eleven.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,680
Pneumonia.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,920
He's got some pneumonia and has been in the hospital a couple of times.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,800
His dad, another male in the family, died of severe infections.

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,720
We have absent CD19 cells and low immunoglobulin levels.

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,600
So what are we going to see?

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,200
We're definitely going to see absence.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,000
A monoclonal spike would make us think of multiple myeloma.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,040
Beta-gamma bridging indicates IgA overproduction

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,760
or cirrhosis, broad-based polyclonal increase.

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,280
That would be seen in an autoimmune condition, and it's definitely not normal.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,960
So let's think of the buzzy buzzwords.

23
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,200
Strep pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, just recurrent respiratory infections.

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,920
Also, if you have a boy with an X-linked disease,

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,760
that should already key you into that a little bit too.

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,240
So encapsulated organisms, no IgG.

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,600
So you have poor opsonization.

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,200
You have no tonsils or lymphoid tissue, right?

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,840
Because those are B cell-dependent organs that are underdeveloped.
