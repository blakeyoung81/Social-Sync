00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Hey everybody, we're gonna break down a step one practice session. Very high yield, so let's start.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,200
40-year-old homeless man with an inflamed spasm and locked jaw. He has a history of drug use and

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,599
abduction. What is the path it has taken? Okay, so we have inflamed spasm, open our jaw, we should be

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,040
thinking of pre-venous metonymy. That’s what we have; the spores are typically transmitted through a

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,000
puncture injury like a splinter or a dirty needle use and what we're gonna do here is we use my

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,800
contagion to go up, boom, identify what injury to the skin means. That's gonna be your rabies virus

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,760
and so that's through the bite wound and the peripheral nerve signals. So that's not gonna be

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,520
your answer, question. We know that this is gonna be tetanus. Why? Because of that jaw. Awesome.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,120
Right, because the toxin spreads in a great way through the lower motor neurons. To the spinal cord and

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,960
the spinal cord, it's gonna block your and it causes this spasm of the infection. Right, the

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,800
recesses are not. Hey, why is it not B? Contaminated food. Well, our little handy-dandy

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,079
chromax hematurgies connects too if you just click the description. This is gonna be contaminated

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,000
food to bloodstream. This is a botch. Right, so that's always starting with contaminated food and spasm

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,840
rather than sending a typical of your botch. That's why this is not the next infected bloodstream.

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,120
So, bloodstream to brain g. That's gonna get bacterial infection causing your brain abscess.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,040
That's with headaches, symptoms like that. So you could think of like staphylococcus aureus

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,719
from the wound, and you can go through the bloodstream to the brain as a brain abscess. And so symptoms can vary

18
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,000
but yeah we have to look out for that unilateral headache. Let's look at this one. Throat infection.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,240
Bloodstream nerves. A throat infection: think diphtheria. It's involving the nasopharyngeal

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,800
exudate. So with diphtheria, we have to think of that smooth membranous pharyngeal exudate.

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,560
And that's gonna be the diphtheria toxin that enters into the system and so that's gonna

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,000
cause myositis. So that is not getting part of the battle with diphtheria, which is rich, right.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,320
So it affects the skin, and then the nerves and the brain cells like the CNS are the rabies.

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,000
Amnesia of food, botulism especially with the nerve endings. Infected wound,

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,200
bacterial infection. That's diphtheria. All right, so now let's see our next one.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,359
Mouth nerve brain area. Okay, so from the mouth, it's going to be the herpes simplex virus that

27
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,359
causes encephalitis in the brain. And so you could classically think of herpes simplex virus type

28
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,439
one that causes your oral labial lesions and it's a super frequent cause of your sporadic and

29
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,840
encephalitis. Meningitis when the virus spreads through what? Trigeminal or the olfactory tract.

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,679
So there you'll have, you know, focal neurological deficits, your seizures, your fever,

31
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:58,079
your inflammation. All right, last one, this is the correct answer. So, we've gone through

32
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,400
systematically identifying what each one is and we know it's going to be F. The reason why is this is

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Clostridium tetani. So, a puncture wound then travels retrogradely in a great fashion

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,240
to the most part. That's going to be a correct answer. So, tetanus. So, it's the oxygen exchange of

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,079
Clostridium tetani. So you transmit it by the spores that are going to be in the skin

36
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,480
via the puncture wound. So it's going to germinate, replicate its tetanus toxin that will spread

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,040
retrogradely through the lower motor neurons to the spinal cord and there it is. These interneurons

38
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,840
and cause that spastic paralysis. All right, so that is a breakdown of this question. So once

39
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,080
again, quick recap: rabies. There it is, rabies injury to the skin, nerves, and bones and then here's

40
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,000
botulism. So the food, amnesia, botulism, infected wound to bloodstream to brain tissue

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,680
that's a bacterial infection, growth infection, bloodstream nerves, olfactory brain area,

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,599
simplex virus, encephalitis and needle and dart pain. If you guys found this helpful, of course

43
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,120
there are a lot of these other AI too well. You can download and simply there's a simplification

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,560
button that will explain the four basic cups of the dental diagnosis. You can actually have

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,200
a great your doctor's all bits of my this. Maybe all sorts of great. So if this is helpful, then

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,560
please consider liking it.
