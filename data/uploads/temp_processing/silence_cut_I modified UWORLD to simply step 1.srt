Hey guys, here's an example of how my crime this question is super easy. A 68-year-old man with

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,920
advanced disease is receiving antibody treatment that blocks a receptor on the T cell. Which receptor is

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,320
it? Well, before the question looked like this, and now with my extension, you click this

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,040
button down here, and it'll load and it'll tell you, boom, a receptor involved in HIV, the receptor

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,480
on the helper T cell that activates or a receptor that blocks that, when blocked, helps activate.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,360
Well, indeed that would be your PD-1 ligand. This guy activates, this is a B cell for instance, and

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,960
HIV uses a receptor 5 to bind to your CD4s, and the antagonist there has been developed into

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,760
HIV, and blockade of your CD4 itself inhibits T cell activation. So with this little extension, you

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,840
guys can simplify these. If you found this helpful, like and subscribe. Also, you can get this software
