Sure, here is the corrected version of the SRT subtitles:

Hey guys, here's an example from my Chrome extension that makes this question super easy.

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,839
A 68-year-old man with advanced melanoma is receiving antibody treatment.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,359
that blocks receptors on the T cells. Which receptor is it? Well, before, the question looked like this.

4
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:21,120
And now with my extension, you click it, click this button down here, and it'll load.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,519
It'll tell you, boom, a receptor involved in HIV entry, a receptor on the helper.

6
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,480
A receptor meaning it's on B cells, a receptor that activates T cells,

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,079
or a receptor that blocks and helps activate the T cells on cancer.

8
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,679
Well, indeed, that would be your PD-1 ligand. This guy activates this as a B cell, for instance,

9
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,200
and B. So, each of these is the chemoreceptor 5 that binds to your CD4s, and the antagonist there

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,000
has been developed and managed to engage HIV, and blockade of your CD4 itself

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,200
inhibits T cell activation. So, with this little extension,

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,560
you guys can simplify these questions. If you find this helpful, like and subscribe.
