1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Constrictive pericarditis. So we think of an increased JVD, also a pericardial knock,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,400
and Kussmaul's sign. Equalization of diastolic pressure is also going to be seen there.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,440
So you see the increased JVP because of the impaired right heart filling. In cirrhosis,

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,480
your JVP is normally going to be normal or low, even if you've got ascites or edema,

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,360
because that's driven by hypoalbuminemia and portal hypertension. So let's imagine you've got some

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,000
thick, fibrotic pericardium. What's that going to do? It's going to restrict your diastolic

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,240
filling of the heart. That's going to lead to an elevated diastolic pressure and also an equalization

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,400
of all the pressures in the four chambers. That'll cause hepatic congestion, peripheral edema, and

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,520
ascites that can mimic your cirrhosis. And so constrictive pericarditis can mimic cirrhosis.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,760
But the difference here, the difference is going to be these jugular veins because the right heart

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,600
can't fill because of the stiff pericardium. So you get that Kussmaul's sign, JVP rising.
