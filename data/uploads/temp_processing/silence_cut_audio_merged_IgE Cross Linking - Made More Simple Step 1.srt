00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
High-yield step question of the day. Did you know that a single allergen can trigger a system-wide

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,840
meltdown in under five minutes? That is the power of IgE crosslinking. Now let's see what my extension

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,960
does to these answer choices here. What is meant by autoantibody binding to the epithelial surface?

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,000
Pemphigus vulgaris. What is meant by Stevens-Johnson syndrome? Well, that's the cell-mediated

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,720
hypersensitivity that the test writers are referring to with B. How about exotoxin-mediated?

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,200
Well, yeah, it's exotoxin, but endotoxin-mediated is from gram-negative bacteria.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,680
Now, because of the inflammatory response, exotoxin-mediated is correct because that makes us think of

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,800
Staphylococcus aureus. It's called its skin, mast cell degranulation, and is related to allergic reactions.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,240
So let's close that and do a practice question. Now that we know what the buzzy test writers are

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,160
trying to get us to think of, we had a patient with hypotension and wheezing near the carrier after

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,760
exposure to an allergen. It's IgE-mediated. Which molecular interaction initiates the degranulation

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,760
process? The answer? Cross-linking. So anaphylaxis is going to begin with the multivalent antigen

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,600
cross-links.
