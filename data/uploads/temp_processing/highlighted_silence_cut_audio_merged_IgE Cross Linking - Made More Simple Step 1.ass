Dialogue: 0,000:00:00.00,000:00:04.64,Default,,0,0,0,,High-yield step question of the day. Did you know that a single allergen can trigger a system-wide
Dialogue: 0,000:00:04.64,000:00:09.84,Default,,0,0,0,,meltdown in under five minutes? That is the power of IgE crosslinking. Now let's see what my extension
Dialogue: 0,000:00:09.84,000:00:14.96,Default,,0,0,0,,does to these answer choices here. What is meant by autoantibody binding to the epithelial surface?
Dialogue: 0,000:00:14.96,000:00:20.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Pemphigus vulgaris. What is meant by Stevens-Johnson syndrome? Well, that's the cell-mediated
Dialogue: 0,000:00:20.00,000:00:24.72,Default,,0,0,0,,hypersensitivity that the test writers are referring to with B. How about exotoxin-mediated?
Dialogue: 0,000:00:24.72,000:00:29.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, yeah, it's exotoxin, but endotoxin-mediated is from gram-negative bacteria.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:29.20,000:00:33.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, because of the inflammatory response, exotoxin-mediated is correct because that makes us think of
Dialogue: 0,000:00:33.68,000:00:38.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Staphylococcus aureus. It's called its skin, mast cell degranulation, and is related to allergic reactions.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:38.80,000:00:42.24,Default,,0,0,0,,So let's close that and do a practice question. Now that we know what the buzzy test writers are
Dialogue: 0,000:00:42.24,000:00:46.16,Default,,0,0,0,,trying to get us to think of, we had a patient with hypotension and wheezing near the carrier after
Dialogue: 0,000:00:46.16,000:00:51.76,Default,,0,0,0,,exposure to an allergen. It's IgE-mediated. Which molecular interaction initiates the degranulation
Dialogue: 0,000:00:51.76,000:00:57.76,Default,,0,0,0,,process? The answer? Cross-linking. So anaphylaxis is going to begin with the multivalent antigen
Dialogue: 0,000:00:57.76,000:01:03.60,Highlight,,0,0,0,,cross-links.
