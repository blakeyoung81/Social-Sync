1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
This is a very important concept: increased carbon dioxide leads to increased cerebral blood flow.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,740
So, CO2 is the most potent cerebral vasodilator.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,720
Yes, that's correct.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,800
In narcotic overdose, we have respiratory depression, decreased respiratory rate, and increased

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,800
CO2 in the blood.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,880
This condition is called hypercapnia.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,960
That means we have increased cerebral blood flow.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,600
Respiratory depression results in elevated CO2 levels.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,320
Hypercapnia indicates that cerebral vasodilation is occurring.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,840
We have a fixed intracranial compartment, so the brain's auto-regulation of flow is affected.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,080
This leads to increased intracranial pressure.

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,680
If a patient is arousable only with painful stimuli, we should suspect narcotic overdose.

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,240
Central hypoventilation leads to increased CO2 and increased vasodilation.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,240
That's it.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,240
That's the secret.

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,160
Opioids depress the respiratory center.

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,600
This decrease in ventilation causes CO2 to build up.

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,520
CO2 can freely cross the blood-brain barrier, combining with water to form carbonic acid,

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,440
which dissociates into hydronium ions, leading to local acidosis.

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,120
Acidosis triggers vasodilation, increasing cranial blood flow and intracranial pressure if

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,120
unchecked.

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,160
Hypercapnia causes an increase in hydronium ions (H+), which leads to respiratory acidosis.

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,160
Here's a practice question.

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,400
A patient is unresponsive after heroin use; the cause is increased perfusion due to respiratory depression and increased CO2.

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is seen in septic shock.

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,560
Hypoxia triggers a pulmonary response in the brain.

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,080
Increased bicarbonate indicates metabolic compensation.
