1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Let's see a question stem where you have a newborn; he's got a

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,400
defect in his anchoring fibrils. This is going to be your type

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,520
VII collagen, and they're going to ask you, "Hey, what's the skin finding?" The

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,480
answer is going to be blisters. So anchoring fibrils should make you think of the

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,680
hemidesmosomes. I don't know why, but I like to think of a little ladder.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,120
You know, a ladder kind of looks like this, and this looks like an "H," and I

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,280
like to think of this as, at the very bottom, like an anchor. It'll tether your

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,120
basal keratinocytes of the epidermis to the dermis. So there's your "H," your

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,040
type VII collagen, and so the epidermis will

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,000
separate from the dermis, and you get a blister. If you don't have that anchoring,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,760
if you don't have that, then that's what you get: mechanical fragility of that

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,440
dermal-epidermal junction. Some trap answers that you might see would be like

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,280
a rash; for that, you think of like Job's syndrome or atopic dermatitis,

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,560
maybe even vasculitis. So that would be like your red patches, not your

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,320
blisters from structural weakness. There'd also be no vesicle rupture,

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,760
not easy bruising; that would make you think of like scurvy, vitamin C

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,360
deficiency. They could say keratodermas or ichthyosis. "Ichthy" makes you think of

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,480
like fish, little like fish skin. That's going to be your thickened skin that's

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,560
due to this stratum corneum buildup. So that's just a different disease. Ulcers,

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,160
that'd be full-thickness loss of your epidermis that exposes the dermis. So you'd see that in like

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,280
lupus, for instance, but this is not that. We're looking at a structural defect here.

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,560
So epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica. It's going to be a type VII collagen defect

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,120
causing your blisters, especially through trauma or friction. Diagnosed on skin biopsy with

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,520
immunofluorescence. There's your educational pearl for the day. We'll see you guys in the next video.
