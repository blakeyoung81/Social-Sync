1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
This is a very important concept.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,380
So, increased carbon dioxide leads to increased cerebral blood flow.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,840
CO2 is the most potent cerebral vasodilator.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,800
Yeah, crazy.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,360
In narcotic overdose, we have respiratory depression,

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,520
decreased respiratory rate, and increased CO2 in the blood.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,680
It's called hypercapnia.

8
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,880
That means we have increased cerebral blood flow.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,560
Respiratory depression means we have more CO2.

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,680
Hypercapnia means you've got some cerebral vasodilation

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,520
going on.

12
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,720
We have a fixed intracranial compartment.

13
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,160
The brain's auto-regulation,

14
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,080
flow in a normal progression, pressure.

15
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,120
If a question stem says "arousable,"

16
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,000
only to painful stimuli, then we should think

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,240
of narcotic overdose.

18
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,680
Central hypoventilation, increased CO2, increased vasodilation.

19
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,520
That's it.

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,360
That's the secret.

21
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,720
Our opioids depress the respiratory center.

22
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,640
This decrease in ventilation causes CO2 to build up.

23
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,040
CO2 will freely cross the blood-brain barrier,

24
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,560
combining with water to form carbonic acid,

25
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,120
which will dissociate into hydronium, and local acidosis

26
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,880
occurs.

27
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,960
Acidosis triggers vasodilation, increased cranial blood flow,

28
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,200
and increased pressure if unchecked.

29
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,400
Hypercapnia causes increased hydronium ions,

30
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,840
which leads to respiratory acidosis.

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,040
Here's a practice question.

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,160
Unresponsive after heroin: cause of increased perfusion,

33
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,440
respiratory depression, increased CO2.

34
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,920
Decreased systemic vascular resistance, that's in septic shock.

35
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,360
Hypoxia is a pulmonary response, not the brain.

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,760
Increased bicarbonate indicates metabolic compensation.

37
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,560
Mean arterial pressure only affects it if it goes outside.

38
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,720
All right, that's all there is.

39
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,120
See you guys in the next video.
