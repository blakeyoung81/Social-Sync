Dialogue: 0,000:00:00.00,000:00:03.74,Default,,0,0,0,,This is a very important concept: increased carbon dioxide leads to increased cerebral blood flow.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:03.74,000:00:04.74,Default,,0,0,0,,So, CO2 is the most potent cerebral vasodilator.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:04.74,000:00:07.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, that's correct.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:07.72,000:00:12.80,Highlight,,0,0,0,,In narcotic overdose, we have respiratory depression, decreased respiratory rate, and increased
Dialogue: 0,000:00:12.80,000:00:13.80,Highlight,,0,0,0,,CO2 in the blood.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:13.80,000:00:14.88,Default,,0,0,0,,This condition is called hypercapnia.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:14.88,000:00:16.96,Default,,0,0,0,,That means we have increased cerebral blood flow.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:16.96,000:00:19.60,Default,,0,0,0,,Respiratory depression results in elevated CO2 levels.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:19.60,000:00:22.32,Highlight,,0,0,0,,Hypercapnia indicates that cerebral vasodilation is occurring.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:22.32,000:00:25.84,Default,,0,0,0,,We have a fixed intracranial compartment, so the brain's auto-regulation of flow is affected.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:25.84,000:00:27.08,Default,,0,0,0,,This leads to increased intracranial pressure.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:27.08,000:00:32.68,Default,,0,0,0,,If a patient is arousable only with painful stimuli, we should suspect narcotic overdose.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:32.68,000:00:37.24,Default,,0,0,0,,Central hypoventilation leads to increased CO2 and increased vasodilation.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:37.24,000:00:38.24,Default,,0,0,0,,That's it.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:38.24,000:00:39.24,Default,,0,0,0,,That's the secret.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:39.24,000:00:42.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Opioids depress the respiratory center.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:42.16,000:00:44.60,Default,,0,0,0,,This decrease in ventilation causes CO2 to build up.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:44.60,000:00:49.52,Default,,0,0,0,,CO2 can freely cross the blood-brain barrier, combining with water to form carbonic acid,
Dialogue: 0,000:00:49.52,000:00:53.44,Default,,0,0,0,,which dissociates into hydronium ions, leading to local acidosis.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:53.44,000:00:57.12,Highlight,,0,0,0,,Acidosis triggers vasodilation, increasing cranial blood flow and intracranial pressure if
Dialogue: 0,000:00:57.12,000:00:58.12,Highlight,,0,0,0,,unchecked.
Dialogue: 0,000:00:58.12,000:01:03.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Hypercapnia causes an increase in hydronium ions (H+), which leads to respiratory acidosis.
Dialogue: 0,000:01:03.16,000:01:04.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Here's a practice question.
Dialogue: 0,000:01:04.16,000:01:10.40,Default,,0,0,0,,A patient is unresponsive after heroin use; the cause is increased perfusion due to respiratory depression and increased CO2.
Dialogue: 0,000:01:10.40,000:01:11.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is seen in septic shock.
Dialogue: 0,000:01:11.40,000:01:13.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Hypoxia triggers a pulmonary response in the brain.
Dialogue: 0,000:01:13.56,000:01:16.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Increased bicarbonate indicates metabolic compensation.
