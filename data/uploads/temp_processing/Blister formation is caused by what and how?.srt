00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Let's see a question stem.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,919
We have a newborn; he's going to defend

3
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:04,120
his anchoring fibrils.

4
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,440
There's going to be a type VII collagen.

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,280
And they're going to ask you, "Hey, what's the skin finding?"

6
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,199
The answer is going to be blisters.

7
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:09,759
So anchoring fibers should make you think

8
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:10,720
of the hemidesmosomes.

9
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,400
I don't know why, but I like to think of a little ladder.

10
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,720
You know, the ladder kind of looks like this

11
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,200
and this looks like an "H."

12
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,160
And I like to think of this, at the very bottom,

13
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,000
as an anchor.

14
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,559
It'll tether your basal keratinocytes

15
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:20,760
of the epidermis to the dermis.

16
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,120
There's your "H," your hemidesmosome.

17
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,640
And that's going to be a type VII collagen.

18
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,440
And so the epidermis will separate from the dermis

19
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,280
and you get a blister.

20
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,880
If you don't have that anchoring, you don't have that.

21
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,359
Then that's what you get: mechanical fragility

22
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,960
of that dermal epidermal junction.

23
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,280
Some trap answers that you might see

24
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,840
would be like a rash for that.

25
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,240
You think of, like, Job's syndrome or atopic dermatitis,

26
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,280
maybe even West Cod Algae.

27
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,719
So that would be like your red patches,

28
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,560
not your blisters from structural weakness.

29
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,160
There would also be no vesicle rupture.

30
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,680
Not easy bruising that would make you think of, like, scurvy,

31
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,760
vitamin C deficiency.

32
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,320
They could say keratodermas or ichthyosis.

33
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,600
"Ichthy" makes you think of a fish, a little like fish skin.

34
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,680
That's going to be your thickened skin

35
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,240
that's due to this straight-up stratum corneum buildup.

36
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,840
So that's just a different disease: ulcers.

37
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,400
That would be full-thickness loss of your epidermis

38
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,560
that exposes the dermis.

39
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,600
So you'd see that in, like, lupus, for instance,

40
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,880
but this is not that.

41
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,840
We're looking at a structural defect here.

42
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,520
So epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica

43
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,200
is going to be a type VII collagen defect

44
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,040
causing your blisters, especially through trauma or friction.

45
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,400
Diagnosed on skin biopsy with immunofluorescence.

46
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,840
Here's your educational pearl for the day.

47
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,439
We'll see you guys in the next video.
