1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Let's see a question stem.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,240
Where you have a newborn, he's got a defect in his

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,440
incering fibrils.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,080
This is going to be your type 7 collagen.

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,200
And they're going to ask you, hey, what's the skin finding?

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,520
The answer is going to be blisters.

7
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,240
So, incering fibers should make you think of the hemidesmizomes.

8
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,280
I don't know why, but I like to think of a little ladder.

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,880
You know, a ladder kind of looks like this,

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,440
and this is like, looks like an H.

11
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,720
And I like to think of this as at the very bottom,

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,720
like an anchor.

13
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,880
It'll tether your basal keratinocytes of the epidermis

14
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,720
to the dermis.

15
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,440
So there's your H, your hemidesmizome.

16
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,360
And that's going to be a type 7 collagen.

17
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,280
And so the epidermis will separate from the dermis,

18
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,120
and you get a blister.

19
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,520
If you don't have that anchoring, if you don't have that,

20
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,720
then that's what you get, mechanical fragility

21
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,640
of that dermal epidermal junction.

22
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,840
Some trap answers that you might see would be like,

23
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,120
like a rash for that you think of like Job's syndrome,

24
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,040
or atopic dermatitis, maybe even whisked algeage.

25
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,480
So that would be like your red patches,

26
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,680
not your blisters from structural weakness.

27
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,640
There'd also be no vesicle rupture.

28
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,880
Not easy bruising that would make you think of like,

29
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,880
scurvy vitamin C deficiency.

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,560
They could say, credodermas or ichthyosis.

31
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,480
Icthy makes you think of like fish, little like fish skin.

32
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,600
That's going to be your thickened skin

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,800
that's due to the stratum corneum buildup.

34
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,800
So that's just a different disease, ulcers.

35
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,720
That'd be full thick loss of your epidermis

36
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,280
that exposes the dermis.

37
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,880
So you'd see that in like lupus, for instance,

38
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,200
but this is not that.

39
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,320
We're looking at a structural defect here.

40
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,160
So epidermolysis, bulosa dystrophica.

41
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,840
It's going to be a type 7 collagen defect

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,200
causing your blisters,

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,920
especially through trauma or friction.

44
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,760
Stagnosed.
