00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
A 6-month-old infant receives a vaccine that includes a bacterial

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,360
capsule polysaccharide conjugated to diphtheria toxoid. What is the immunological advantage

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,600
conferred by this conjugation? It's going to be enhanced class switching through T helper cells.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,880
Infants under two years old can't mount a memory response to plain polysaccharide antigens;

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,000
they just can't do it.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,760
But when you conjugate that capsule to a protein like tetanus toxoid, then it recruits T helper cells

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,920
and enables class switching, affinity maturation, and immunological memory. So that's how conjugate

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:39,280
vaccines work. It's not because of the toxoid, but because of that teamwork. It's because of that robust T cell-dependent immunity.

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,320
So let's look at these trap answers. Mucosal IgA is induced by oral and intranasal vaccines and mucosal infections,

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,480
not systemic conjugates. TLR4 recognizes your LPS, not capsular polysaccharides.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,680
Somatic hypermutation is the advantage of conjugation as T cell helpers, not diversification.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:05,200
M cells are involved in mucosal antigen sampling, unrelated to conjugate vaccines. Like and subscribe for a new question every day.
